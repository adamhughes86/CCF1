# FAQ

## Why have a standard?
Working with large teams of multiple developers requires consistency. Having a clear styleguide for CSS and general preprocessing rules will make this easier for developers to maintain. Having a standard will mean that from start of a project developers will know what the CSS should look like and will have to spend less time worrying about formatting.

## Why should I use it?
You don't have to. This is only one option that hopefully some people will get on board with. It should mean that individuals and companies don't have to spend time creating their own standards or style guides.

## How do I get involved?
If you want to make suggestions feel free to leave it as an issue or make a pull request. If you would like to be a contributor feel free to email me and state why you would like to be a part of the project.

## Why are the declarations sorted alphabetically?
I considered using a grouped by type method for quite a while but decided that it still led to some ambiguity. Grouping by type will definately suit some people more but I wanted to create a standard that could be used easily and quickly.

## Who are the people responsible for the standard?
Just me, Adam Hughes at the moment. I would like to get additional people on board though.

## What inspired this project?
I've noticed over the past couple of years the growth of internal styleguides. Google, Git and many others publish their coding styleguides for everyone to see and they're all a bit different. They do share quite a lot of similarities though, most of which I agreed with. Also many other languages (PHP has PSR for example) have styleguides so I thought why not CSS. With the growth of Preprocessors as well has come with a variety of ways to write CSS. Having a standard can help with consistency across all of these different subsets of CSS. Lastly I wanted to put something in place for myself and my team and thought that if it was shared more people may get on board.
