# FAQ

## Why have a standard?
Working with large teams of multiple developers requires consistency. Having a clear styleguide for CSS and general preprocessing rules will make this easier for developers to maintain. Having a standard will mean that from start of a project developers will know what the CSS should look like and will have to spend less time worrying about formatting.

## Why should I use it?
You don't have to. This is only one option that hopefully some people will get on board with. It should mean that individuals and companies don't have to spend time creating their own standards or style guides.

## How do I get involved?
If you want to make suggestions feel free to leave it as an issue or make a pull request. If you would like to be a contributor feel free to email me and state why you would like to be a part of the project.

## Why are the declarations sorted alphabetically?
I considered using a grouped by type method for quite a while but decided that it still led to some ambiguity. Grouping by type will definately suit some people more but I wanted to create a standard that could be used easily and quickly.
