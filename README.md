Consistent CSS Formatting - A CSS Formatting Standard

## Why have a standard?
Working with large teams of multiple developers requires consistency. Having a clear styleguide for CSS and general preprocessing rules will make this easier for developers to maintain. Having a standard will mean that from start of a project developers will know what the CSS should look like and will have to spend less time worrying about formatting.

## Why should I use it?
You don't have to. This is only one option that hopefully some people will get on board with. It should mean that individuals and companies don't have to spend time creating their own standards or style guides.

## Overview
These standards are only applied to Input CSS and not Output CSS. With ever expanding Preprocessor use it is harder to maintain your output CSS if you want to make use of extends and mixins. By defining that this standard only applies to Input CSS means we donâ€™t need to worry about using a Preprocessor or writing in standard CSS.
